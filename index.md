Can't code? Can't hack? Can't do anything cool on the command line?
This game will give you an excuse to spend some time in the terminal nevertheless.

Be a cool kid, be in the terminal. Play nudoku!

As a bonus you will even learn the basic **vi** movement commands.


### Features 
nudoku can also generate PDF files, like [this](http://jubalh.github.io/nudoku/riddle.pdf), containing sudokus and create single sudoku PNGs like the following:
